## 2. Pros and cons of TDD  
**Pros:** <br>
- TDD requires developers to consider requirements, architecture and module design before they start writing code, which allows teams to identify hidden defects from the start and adopt a more easily understood architectural design, enhancing project reliability, extensibility and maintainability
- Through CI/CD and other means, the development team does not have to worry about modifying the code that will damage the health of the project, simplifying the development process and simplifying communication within the team
- TDD avoids the problem of insufficient testing by development teams due to tight schedules, ensuring project quality
- TDD helps to easily locate bugs in large projects.<br>
**Cons:** <br>
- Many developers are not familiar with TDD, which means that new members of the team may take longer to adapt, which raises the company's training costs
- Test functions need to be maintained frequently, otherwise TDD will become meaningless
- When refactoring the project code, the test functions also need to be rewritten, which further increases the development time of the project
